            With just HTML and CSS the website looks good but not interactive. JavaScript adds functionality to the website.
            Nowadays, JavaScript is runs entire the web, not only the front-end but also in back-end using Node.js.
            Node.js is responsible for javascript running on the server side or backend.

            So here are some reasons why JavaScript is gain popularity from past years
        </h3>

            <h4>Beginner friendly</h4>
        <p>
            Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about it is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there's no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!
            Another advantage of learning JavaScript as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of code, you'll immediately see visible results.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript provides a crucial introduction to key principles and practices that you'll take with you throughout your career as a developer.
        </p>

            <h4>Javascript experts are versatile</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is an extremely versatile language. Once you've mastered it, the possibilities are endless: you can code on the client-side (frontend) using Angular and on the server-side (backend) using Node.js. You can also develop web, mobile, and desktop apps using React.js, React Native, and Electron, and you can even get involved in machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>   
            If you want to become a frontend developer, JavaScript is a prerequisite. However, that's not the only career path open to you as a JS expert. Mastering this key programming language could see you go on to work in full-stack development, games development, information security software engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence—to name just a few!

        </p>
           <h4>Performance</h4> 
        <p>
            JavaScript is not the fastest language but it is fast. This combined with scalability, asynchronicity and ease of use makes JavaScript ideal for most tasks.
        </p>
            <h4>Community</h4>
            <p>
            Most popular languages have good communities and JavaScript is no exception. Due to its current popularity the growth rate in terms of support, e.g. tutorials, books, stackoverflow answers… is impressive. JavaScript frameworks and libraries are comprehensive and improving. There is open source code for doing just about anything.
